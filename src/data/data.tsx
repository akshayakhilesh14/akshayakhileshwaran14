  As a natural communicator, I discovered my love for public speaking. I actively sought opportunities to share my knowledge and ideas with others, whether it was presenting a project in front of my classmates or participating in debate competitions.
  I have always desired to make a positive impact in the world, and through my curiosity and eagerness, I have undertaken many opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to solving complex problems.
  As I embark on the next phase of my academic journey, I'm looking for chances to work together with people who are interested in data science and machine learning, just like me.`,
